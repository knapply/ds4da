## `/home` folder

Widgets from the Hugo Academic theme that make up the home page are found in the `/home` folder. 

For those who are not familiar with the Hugo Academic theme, a "widget" is one of those distinguishable "rows" on the homepage. You can learn more about them at [Hugo Academic's "Page Builder" documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/).

## `/authors` folder

This folder contains info about the teaching team that feeds into the widget on the home page. Hugo Academic requires this specific structure.

## All other files and folders

Documents for producing other web pages. These have to be specifically linked to from the home page (or somewhere else accessible) in order for a viewer to access them.

This website has the `blogdown` package wrapping it, meaning that the website is best set up with `.Rmd` source files.
